- Deployment: Ubuntu EC2 + PM2

# Functional Requirements:
1. Upload and analyze documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
2. Automatically extract and summarize key content based on user-provided keywords
3. Summarize text in both English and Nepali
4. Train chatbot using plain text, Q&A pairs, or project brief documents
5. Store and retrieve summaries through a web dashboard
